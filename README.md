# webpack-vue-lib

The intention of this repository is to try ways to build a vue-cli project into a commonjs library with file names hashed to avoid browser cache problems when importing to any other project.

## Project setup
```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
yarn run build
```


### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
